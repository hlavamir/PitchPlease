trivia:
it is the year 2001. pop-music is dominated by the weird phenomenon of girl- and boy-bands, while a group of nerds are working on a software called vvvv. at some point they work on a substantial feature for it, a client/server render-system. one of the more popular boygroups of the time is called "nsync" and it strikes them that their synchronous dancing somehow resembles the idea of their networked rendering system, which thus gets dubbed "boygrouping".

using such a gendered term created an imbalance. but luckily pop-culture offered a solution to this dilemma: the term "girlpower". popularized by a band called the "spice girls", it seemed like a good fit - if just by its sound - to restore the balance. therefore the folder containing a wild collection of demo patches was dubbed "girlpower".
